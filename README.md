Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs is crucial for creating software that can evolve and scale over time. To achieve this, it's important to follow best practices such as writing modular, well-structured code, using descriptive variable and function names, and commenting code to explain what it does.

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In the case of the CRUD Python module from Project One, we used a modular design that separated the database logic from the rest of the application. This made it easier to maintain and adapt the code over time because changes to the database schema could be made in one place, without affecting the rest of the application. In Project Two, this module was used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database, providing a clean and reliable way to store and retrieve data.

The advantages of working in this way include increased code reusability, reduced duplication, and a more straightforward codebase that's easier to test and debug. In the future, this CRUD Python module could be used for a variety of projects, including web applications, data analysis tools, and more.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, approaching problems requires breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. This involves understanding the requirements, designing a solution, implementing the solution, and testing it thoroughly. In the case of the Grazioso Salvare project, we approached the problem by creating a database schema that could store information about animals and their medical records, and a dashboard that could display that data in a user-friendly way.

Our approach to this project differed from previous assignments in other courses in that we had to work closely with a client to understand their specific needs and requirements. This required more communication and collaboration than in other assignments, but ultimately led to a more tailored solution that met the client's needs.

To create databases to meet other client requests, I would use techniques such as creating an ER diagram to model the relationships between different entities, selecting an appropriate database management system, and writing SQL scripts to create and modify tables.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are responsible for designing and developing software, algorithms, and systems to solve complex problems. This work is essential for businesses like Grazioso Salvare because it enables them to store and manage data in a way that is efficient, reliable, and scalable. By creating a well-designed database and dashboard, we helped Grazioso Salvare to manage their animal records more effectively, leading to improved patient care and streamlined operations.
